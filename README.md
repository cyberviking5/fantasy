## How It Works

1. **Choose a Sport:** Select your preferred sport (cricket, football, or hockey) and pick an upcoming match to bet on.

2. **Place Your Bet:** Enter your desired entry fee and place your bet. Your bet is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain as a smart contract.

3. **Watch the Match:** Sit back and enjoy the match. Once the match is over, the smart contract determines the outcome of your bet based on the match results.

4. **Win Rewards:** If your bet is successful, you'll receive an instant 2x payout of your entry fee, and you might even earn NFTs as rewards.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.

3. Compile and deploy the smart contracts using Hardhat.

4. Start the React frontend using `npm start`.

5. Interact with the dApp on your localhost.
